###### Import the random Module #####

import time
import os

###### Here are your list of Fighters #####

    'Piccolo',

    'Broly',
    'Gohan',
    'Android 17',
    'Android 18',
    'Cell',
    'Frieza',
    'Majin Buu',
    'Dabura'
]

#####  Attacks List #####
attacks = ['kick' ,'throw' ,'punch']

# I needed to represent what attack beats the other in condition

    ('kick' , 'throw'),
    ('punch' , 'kick')
]

##### Choosing the Characters for the fight #####
player = random.choice(fighters)
opponent = random.choice(fighters)

character = [
    ('player', player),
    ('opponent', opponent)
]

##### Announce Game Start #####
print("-" * 50)
print("Welcome to the fight club! The battle awaits!")
print("-" * 50)

##### Initialize Scoring Variables #####

# Create a loop that will run UNTIL either the player or opponent scores 5 points
# Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

# This code needs to be nested inside your loop ðŸ‘‡
# THINK: Recall that any code nested inside a loop will run each time the loop executes
##### Choosing the attack #####

# Create a scoring system to record 1 point for each 'win' scored by either the player or the opponent
# HINT: You will need to use conditionals to compare the attacks
# HINT: You will need to update the score variables 
# Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

# Punch > Throw      
# Throw > Kicks
# Kicks > Punch

# Create a conditional outside of the loop to print the winner's name.
# Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
