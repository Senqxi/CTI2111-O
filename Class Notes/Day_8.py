# # Difficult for David to find blue marbles. One day he visits a hobby shop that sells marbles. There is a secret bag inside the store. Each day, children
# # may pull up to 5 marbles(one at a time) from the bag in the hopes of finding the color marble they seek. In David's case, 
# # this is a blue marble. Any marble that isn't kept must be returned to the bag. If David locates a blue marble, 
# # that will be the last selection and he will stop choosing marbles.

# # Create a program that tracks how many times David picks a marble from the secret bag and confirm whether the marble chosen is blue. If blue is picked,
# # add that blue marble to David's collection. We also want to remove that blue marble from the secret bag's inventory. Remember you only have 5 chances per day
